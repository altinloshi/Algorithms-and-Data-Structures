B.
worst case is O(n^2) when all the elements needs to be moved 
to their postion through swaps
best case is O(n)when the array is already sorted, and it 
requires only one pass to check if everything is on order
average case is  O(n/2 x n) = O(n/2 x n) = O(n/2 x n) = O(n/2 x n) = O (n^2)

C.
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort are stable because they preserve 
the relative order of equal elements during sorting.

Heap Sort is considered unstable because its swapping operations
 may alter the relative positions of equal elements within the sorted array.

D.
The sorting algorithms in which the order of elements affects the time complexity of the sorting algorithm
 is known as an adaptive sorting algorithm. so insertion sort and bubble sort


The sorting algorithms in which the order of elements of the data doesnâ€™t affect the time complexity of the 
sorting algorithms are known as non-adaptive sorting algorithms. Merge sort and heap sort
