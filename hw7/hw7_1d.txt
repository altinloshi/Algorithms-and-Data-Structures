Median Version: Although this version theoretically selects the most appropriate pivot to ensure efficiency 
by avoiding cases where the pivot is the smallest or largest element, it suffers from prolonged pivot selection time.
This prolonged selection time contributes to its inferior performance compared to the other two versions.

Lomuto Version: Despite not putting much emphasis on avoiding the selection of a poor pivot, 
the Lomuto version remains quite efficient and even outperforms the Median Version. The lack of effort 
in calculating the optimal pivot, unlike the Median Version, contributes to its efficiency.

Hoare Version: The Hoare version of Quicksort emerges as the top performer among the three. This outcome is logical 
since the pivot selection method used in this version is both rapid (requires minimal computation) and effective in avoiding poor pivots.
