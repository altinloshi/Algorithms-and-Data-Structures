The algorithm is considered in-situ because it utilizes a fixed amount of additional memory to reverse the linked list,
irrespective of the list's size. This implies that the algorithm allocates the same amount of extra memory regardless 
of the length of the linked list.

Regarding its time complexity, it operates in O(n) time. This is due to the presence of a single loop that terminates 
upon reaching the end of the linked list.
