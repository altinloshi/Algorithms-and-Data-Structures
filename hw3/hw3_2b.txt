Initialization: first iteration the outer loop (i=0) the subarray 
arr[0:0]have a single elemnt, which is sorted.

Maintenance: now the subarray is sorted arr[0:1] is sorted, now the current iteration, inner loop finds index of the minimum element in the unsorted 
array arr[i:n]. then swaps the minimum element with the current one arr[i]= arr[min_index] now the subarray is sorted as arr[0:i+1].

Termination: the condition to end is when i becomes n-1. this means that the outer loop has iterated the whole array and now is sorted. and the last 
element is it on its place because of the last iteration so it is completely sorted.
