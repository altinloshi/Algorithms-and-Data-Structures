a2) Show that a greedy algorithm for the activity-selection problem that makes 
the greedy choice of selecting the activity with shortest duration may fail at 
producing a globally optimal solution.

a2) If the activities are not sorted by ascending order based on the start-time 
(i.e from the one that starts the earilest all the way to the one that ends 
last), then the greedy algorithm would fail at getting a globally 
optimal solution since it assumes that activities are sorted based in that 
manner.

Another scenario of when the greedy algorithm will fail is when the globally
optimal solution is not based on one criterion but multiple. Such a case where
there are multiple criteria is the Knapsack Problem.

===============================================================================

b2) Assuming an unsorted sequence of activities, derive a greedy algorithm for 
the activity-selection problem that selects the activity with the latest 
starting time. Your solution should not simply sort the activities and then 
select the activity.

b2)

latest_greedy(activities):
    latest_activity = activities[0]

    for i=2 to activities.size:
        if activities[i].start > latest_activity.start:
            latest_activity = activities[i]

    return latest_activity
